# Pig-Game 

Pig Game is a simple and fun dice game that involves strategy and an element of luck. The object of the game is to accumulate a certain number of points, usually 100, while avoiding certain combinations of dice that can cancel your points,
in this case is number 1.

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

- Default win score is 10 (for testing purpose).
- If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their current score and the player's turn continues.
- If a player chooses to "hold", their curent score is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
